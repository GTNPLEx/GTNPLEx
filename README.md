# 👋 Hi, I’m Patrica! 

Welcome to my cyberwonderland of code, creativity, and curiosity. 🚀  

I’m a programmer who loves building things that feel like magic—whether it’s crafting sleek audio plugins, designing interactive UIs, or diving into the depths of DSP and Rust. My journey is all about exploring the intersection of technology and art, and I wish I started this adventure 10 years ago! ^_*

## 🌌 What I Do

- **🎛️ Audio Plugins**: I build VSTs and CLAP plugins that make music production fun and intuitive. Think rotatable knobs, real-time visual feedback, and smooth, powerful sound.
- **🖥️ UI/UX Design**: I love creating interfaces that are not just functional but also beautiful and immersive. SVG graphics, animations, and intuitive layouts are my jam.
- **🦀 Rust Enthusiast**: I’m passionate about Rust for its performance, safety, and modern tooling. It’s my go-to for building high-performance applications.
- **🔮 Cyberwonderland Explorer**: I’m always experimenting with new tech, frameworks, and creative coding projects. If it’s futuristic, interactive, or just plain cool, I’m in!

## 🛠️ My Toolkit

- **Languages**: Rust, C++, Python, JavaScript
- **Frameworks**: nih-plug, Iced, React
- **Tools**: VS Code, Git, Docker, Blender (for 3D art)
- **Design**: SVG, Figma, Adobe Creative Suite

## 🌟 Why I Code

For me, programming is more than just writing code—it’s about creating experiences. Whether it’s a plugin that inspires a new track, a UI that feels like a work of art, or a tool that empowers others, I’m here to make the digital world a little more magical.

## 🎶 Fun Facts About Me

- I’m obsessed with synthwave, cyberpunk aesthetics, and retro-futurism. Think neon lights, glitch art, and 80s vibes.
- I love experimenting with generative art and procedural music.
- I’m a firm believer that the best code is both functional and beautiful.
